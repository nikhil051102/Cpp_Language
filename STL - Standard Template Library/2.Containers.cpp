/*
There are 3 types of Container :
1) Sequence Container :- Object which stores data in 'Sequence Fashion'. ex. 1)Vector  2)List  3)Dequeue
2) Associative Container :- Object which gives 'Direct Access' to stored data. ex. 1)Set 2)Multiset 3)Map 4)Multimap
3) Derived Container :- Related to Real World Modelling. ex.1)Stack 2)Queue


When to use which ?
1) Sequence Container :-
                a)Vector : Random Access - Fast
                           Middle Insertion/Deletion - Slow
                           Insertion/Deletion at the End - Fast
                b)List : Random Access - Slow
                         Middle Insetion/Deletion - Fast
                         Insertion/Deletion at the End - Fast

2) Associative Sequence :- All Operation are Fast except Random Access.

3) Derived Sequence :- Depends.
